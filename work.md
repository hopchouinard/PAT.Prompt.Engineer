I need your help designing a meta prompt specifically made to add the concept of asking questions to the user in order to better understand the goal of a specific request. This is a prompt designing technique that I have been using for a while now and I think it would be a great addition to the meta prompt library. I have a few ideas on how to implement this, but I would like to hear your thoughts on this first.

The idea is for this meta prompt to take an idea or goal as input and then ask the user a series of questions to better understand the goal. The questions would be designed to help the user think through the goal and provide more context on what they are trying to achieve. The meta prompt would then use this information to generate a more specific prompt that is tailored to the user's needs.

One important aspect of this technique is to make sure the questions are asked one at a time so each answers can be used by the AI to make sure the next question is relevant. This would require the meta prompt to keep track of the answers and use them to generate the next question. It also help the AI to know when to stop asking questions and generate the final prompt.

Please use this technique now to help you with this task.
