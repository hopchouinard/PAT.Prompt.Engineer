   - For each improvement, specify:
     - Detailed description
     - Expected impact
     - Degree of importance (Critical/Important/Minor)
     - Justification

4. OPTIMIZATION
   - Integrate the identified improvements
   - Maintain overall coherence
   - Verify the clarity of instructions
   - Ensure compatibility of modifications
